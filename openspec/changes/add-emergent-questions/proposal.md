## Why

The "emergent" backend has functionality where the LLM can ask questions directly to the user during execution. Currently, Diane does not surface these questions. We need to implement a thin layer on top of this functionality in both the CLI and the GUI to list these questions and allow the user to provide answers, enabling truly interactive agent workflows.

## What Changes

- Add a service/client layer to fetch pending questions from the Emergent backend (using the OpenAPI spec at `http://mcj-emergent:3002/openapi.json`).
- Add a mechanism to submit the user's answers back to the Emergent backend.
- Implement CLI commands to list pending questions and prompt the user for an answer.
- Implement a SwiftUI interface in the native macOS app to display active questions and provide an input form for the user to answer them.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `emergent-questions`: Handling the fetching, displaying, and answering of questions generated by the Emergent backend.

### Modified Capabilities


## Impact

- **API Client**: Needs new endpoints integrated based on the Emergent OpenAPI spec.
- **CLI**: Needs new commands or interactive prompts to handle questions.
- **GUI (SwiftUI)**: Needs new views and state management to display questions and accept input, adhering to the standard component guidelines and tokens.
